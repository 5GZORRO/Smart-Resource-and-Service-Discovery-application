First step:

You make the code changes inside SRD_rc.py file and then you are good to go!

Step two:

open terminal inside this folder

Now you have to rebuild the docker container and then upload to my dockerhub
(just copy-paste the commands inside README-docker push.txt)
(have a strong network connection for that and preferably outside of any VPN!)

Step three:

open terminal inside 5G_barcelona_deployment folder

follow README instructrions.
