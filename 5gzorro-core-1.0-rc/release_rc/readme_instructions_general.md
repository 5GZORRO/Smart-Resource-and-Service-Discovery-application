### First step:

You make the code changes inside SRD_rc.py file and then you are good to go!

### Step two:

Open terminal inside this folder.

Now you have to rebuild the docker container and then upload to my dockerhub.
(just copy-paste the commands inside README-docker push.txt)
(have a strong network connection for that and preferably outside of any VPN!)

### Step three:

Open terminal inside 5G_barcelona_deployment folder.

Follow README instructrions.
